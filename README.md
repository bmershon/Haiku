# Haiku

Dear Washington Post Intern,

Please make sure you have joined the internz-wax-poetic HipChat room. **Just join it, don't say anything yet.**

In the `internz-wax-poetic` HipChat room, every intern is expected to post one response, and that response is a Haiku. A Haiku is a type of poem with a specific structure: the first line contains 5 syllables, the second 7 syllables, and the third 5 syllables, for a total of 17 syllables. Here's an example (from a recent Reddit comment):

> Batman taken out  
by a Toyota Camry.  
This world is fucked up.

Now is the time to leave your indelible mark on what will eventually become a collection of **anonymous** Haikus from the 2015 class of WaPo interns.

**Take your time.** Think of what you want to say about your current feelings, the internship you've had, the friends you've met, or how annoying it was to have your car window smashed that one time in Foggy Bottom. You're all creative folks. This is a constrained writing exercise, and you will come up with something that others find interesting.

Only post your own original Haiku. No comments from the peanut gallery please! Encourage other interns who have not yet posted to not *miss a deadline*.

Thanks,

Management
